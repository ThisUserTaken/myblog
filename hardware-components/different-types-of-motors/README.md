Electric motors are most commonly classified based on the type of power they use: **AC (Alternating Current)** or **DC (Direct Current)**.

* **AC motors** operate on alternating current, the type of electricity produced by power plants and distributed to homes and businesses through high-voltage power lines. In AC, the current periodically reverses direction.
* **DC motors**, on the other hand, run on direct current, which flows in a single direction and is typically supplied by batteries. Since batteries provide portable, consistent power, DC motors are more suitable for applications requiring mobility, such as **robots**. For this reason, AC motors are generally unsuitable for most **robotic projects**, as they rely on a constant connection to an external AC power source, limiting mobility and flexibility. DC motors, powered by batteries, allow for wireless operation, which is essential for robotics and other mobile applications.
