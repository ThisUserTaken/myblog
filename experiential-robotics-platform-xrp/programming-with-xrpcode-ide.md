# Programming with XRPCode IDE

XRPCode is a web-based development tool that is run in either the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers. XRPCode can be used to create either Python or Blockly language programs that run natively on the XRP control board. Blockly programs are first translated to Python and then run. You can view or even translate the Blockly program into a Python program.

Run XRPCode by navigating to the [XRPCode web site](https://xrpcode.wpi.edu/).

This is basic training, a detailed guide can be found in [https://xrpusersguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/XRPCode.html](https://xrpusersguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/XRPCode.html)
