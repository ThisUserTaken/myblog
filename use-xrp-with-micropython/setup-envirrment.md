Open Thonny from your application launcher. It should look something like this:

You can use Thonny to write standard Python code. Type the following in the main window, and then click the **Run** button (you will be asked to save the file).

```python3
print('Hello World!')
```

Find the BOOTSEL button on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

Press the BOOTSEL button and hold it while you connect the other end of the micro USB cable to your computer.&#x20;

In the bottom right-hand corner of the Thonny window, you will see the version of Python that you are currently using.

Click on the Python version and choose ‘MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)’:

If you don’t see this option, then check that you have plugged in your Raspberry Pi Pico.

A dialog box will pop up to install the latest version of the MicroPython firmware on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

Click the **Install** button to copy the firmware to your Raspberry Pi Pico.

Wait for the installation to complete and click **Close**.

You can also access the firmware installation menu if you click on ‘MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)’ in the status bar and choose ‘Configure interpreter …’.
