# Experiential Robotics Platform (XRP)&#x20;

The XRP (Experiential Robotics Platform) \[beta], started by WPI and DEKA Research & Development Corp., aims to level the STEM playing field globally and create a future generation of STEM innovators and technology leaders. Its simple, tool-free assembly means robots can be built quickly, and replacement parts can be easily 3-D printed. As part of this platform, WPI will provide virtual support through online courses and will guide students and teachers through the new system, including the ability to scale up using the same hardware with free software updates.

All the same, tools used for programming full-sized FRC robots can be used to program the XRP. The XRP comes with two drive motors and integrated wheel encoders. It also includes an IMU sensor that can be used to measure headings and accelerations. Using it is as simple as writing a robot program, and running it on your computer.&#x20;

XRP can be programmed with 5 different methods.&#x20;

1.  **Blockly**

    A graphical programming system based on Scratch to make it easier to start coding your robot without the need to the syntax of Python. Internally, a Blockly program is translated to Python and saved on the robot. Users can even see the generated Python code to help them learn to use the language themselves.&#x20;
2.  **Python**

    An object-oriented text-based programming language used throughout industry and taught in many classrooms.
3. **Java/Python/C++ with wpilib**
4. **With Generic platform**&#x20;
5. **ROS**
